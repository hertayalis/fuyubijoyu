He is a left-handed batsman and occasional wicket-keeper.</p><p>Duckett began his cricket career by joining the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club as a youngster. He made his debut for the club in 2012, during a T20 match against Yorkshire. He quickly established himself as a promising young player, and his consistent performances in domestic cricket earned him a call-up to the England Lions squad in 2015.</p><p>In 2016, Duckett was selected to play for the England cricket team in their tour of Bangladesh. He made his debut in the second ODI of the series, where he scored an impressive 60 runs and helped England secure a win. Later that year, he was also included in England’s Test squad for their series against India.</p><p>Despite showing early promise with the national team, Duckett’s international career has been somewhat stop-start due to inconsistent performances and off-field controversies. He was dropped from the England team after scoring just 110 runs in four Tests against India in 2016. In 2017, he was suspended by the ECB for pouring a drink over senior England bowler James Anderson during a post-match celebration.</p><p>After leaving Northamptonshire in 2018, Duckett joined Nottinghamshire on a three-year contract. He has since shown a return to form, and his performances with the bat have helped Nottinghamshire win several key matches in both the T20 Blast and County Championship.</p><p>In 2020, Ben Duckett was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. He was later included in England’s 24-man squad to start training for the ODI series against Ireland.</p><p>In late 2022, Duckett was brought into the England side for a tour of Pakistan due to his skill in the Bazball style adopted by the team under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. He had immediate success, scoring the fastest ever England century opening stand with Zak Crawley and also the fastest double-century partnership in Test cricket history with Crawley. Duckett remained in the side for the rest of the series.</p><p>During the 2022 tournament, he managed to score more than 200 runs despite Welsh Fire’s winless season. He was picked as the first choice by Birmingham Phoenix in the draft and joined the team after leaving Welsh Fire in 2023.</p><p>Ben Duckett’s career has been one of ups and downs, but his talent and potential remain undeniable. As he continues to gain experience at the domestic level, many fans and experts believe that he has the ability to become a regular fixture in the England team once again.</p><p>Ben Duckett has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Duckett Age</h2><p>How old is Ben Duckett?
