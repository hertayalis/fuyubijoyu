Eighteen years ago?) stoner comedy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back</strong></a>&nbsp;would have been such a resounding success? In fact, it even beat out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avengers: Endgame</a>&nbsp;in one particular box office record, making more on average per screen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in its opening week</a> than the MCU film did. And pretty soon, you’ll be able to own your own copy as well, as we’re getting word that fans can now pre-order the movie on Blu-ray and DVD.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>According to Legion M – which helped finance the pic – Jay And Silent Bob Reboot will be officially released on home video on January 21st, 2020, which is great and all because there isn’t long to wait, but it does mean that there’s no chance of it being a Christmas gift. And that’s certainly a shame.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>On top of the disc itself though, fans who pre-order from the site linked below will also get a replica Chronic Con badge that both Jay and Bob wear in the movie. Not bad, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jay-and-Silent-Bob-Reboot-poster.png><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>For those who haven’t seen it yet, the remake essentially retreads the same plot from the original (the clue is in the title, we guess) in which the titular characters (played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith himself) trek to Hollywood to stop a movie being made about comic book characters that share their likeness.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>However, there is one difference to the story in that Jay discovers that Justice (his love interest in the original played by Shannon Elizabeth) was pregnant with his daughter and didn’t tell him. The film is also chock full of references and Easter eggs, and Smith has said this will be his first effort to feature a commentary track. Sadly, however, this won’t be on the DVD or Blu-ray as he’s apparently saving it for his podcast.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Still, fans will surely want to take home <strong>Jay And Silent Bob Reboot</strong> when it hits home video early next year and if you want to secure your copy early, be sure to place your pre-order via the link below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqxXZa7pXnSoqOepqRir7CujKucm6efqXqjuNRmqZqxXZnDpXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
