Flaunting her ranch girl attire in a camo hoodie and straw hat, Stefani shared glimpses of her farm-grown vegetables in the video.</p><p>The flowers they plucked from the garden were then neatly arranged indoors on their dining table. In the video, sneak peeks of their dining room could be seen. A large metal peacock was placed in the corner of the room. The room had a summer vibe, with leafy wallpaper and bare surfaces were painted in teal.</p><h2 class=split>The picturesque house</h2><p>The house consists of a long driveway dotted with two rows of trees on each side. The picturesque white-colored mansion with a gray slated roof is located in front of a calm water body. The large mansion has Roman columns, a large front porch, a balcony, and an upper-floor deck, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>. Dormer windows and chimneys are visible out of the roof.&nbsp;</p><p>The main building is divided into three sections and the complex also has another detached stone house. The main building has a large middle house with two symmetrical side wings. The backyard is tastefully decorated with a terraced garden, three covered patios, and a pool with a Baja shelf.&nbsp;</p><p>One mile from the main property, there is a small homely chapel where the couple got married on July 3, 2021.

The house sits comfortably on the property, which is more than 1,300 acres.
