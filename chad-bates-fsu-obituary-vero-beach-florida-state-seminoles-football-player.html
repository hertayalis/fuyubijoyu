Chad, who was born in Miami, Florida on May 10, 1974, was a cherished son, father, brother, and friend. He was born on that day.</p><p>After graduating from Spring Valley High School, Chad was able to continue his education at Florida State University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics. Chad achieved a high level of success during his tenure at the university, earning him a spot on the first team of All-ACC football players. After that, he decided to follow his interest in football and played in the European league. After that, he had a brief season with the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Chad had a profound love for music, sports, cuisine, and the great outdoors in addition to his work in sales. He also had a passion for the outdoors. With a heart that bled garnet and gold for his cherished Florida State Seminoles, he was a sports fanatic who was truly passionate about the team. Fishing was another activity that Chad enjoyed, and despite his lack of competence, he was always having a wonderful time whenever he played golf. When it came to helping other people, his friends knew him to be a humorous and generous person who would go out of his way to assist others. The amount of love that Chad had for his family was incalculable, and he treasured each and every moment that he lived with them.</p><p>His parents, Junior and Carolyn Bates, as well as his children, Cami and Cole, through his prior relationship with Nikki Cornwell, and Piper Bates, through his marriage to Jennifer Powers, are among those who are left behind after Chad’s passing.
