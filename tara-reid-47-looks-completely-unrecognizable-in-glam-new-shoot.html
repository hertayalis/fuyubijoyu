Such clarity doesn't just come from a place of annoyance but from a woman tired of having her narrative hijacked by public speculation.</p><p id=eMqzA319uoi data-wc=40>The narrative has been an insistent one, but Tara is determined to reshape it. "Anyone that says I'm anorexic or bulimic, they're wrong. Leave me alone.
