Holloway went missing on May 30, 2005, on the island, and her case garnered significant media attention. Despite extensive investigations, her disappearance remains unsolved.</p><p>Van der Sloot’s criminal activities continued in 2010 when he murdered Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru. This tragic event occurred exactly five years after Holloway’s disappearance. After committing the crime, Van der Sloot fled to Chile to avoid capture. However, he was arrested there and extradited back to Peru for questioning regarding Flores’ murder.</p><p>On June 7, 2010, Van der Sloot confessed to bludgeoning Flores, but he later attempted to retract his confession, claiming coercion by the Peruvian police and framing by the FBI. However, a Peruvian judge deemed the confession valid on June 25, 2010. Subsequently, on January 13, 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years’ imprisonment for the murder of Flores.</p><p>In addition to his conviction for Flores’ murder, Van der Sloot faced legal troubles while in prison. In January 2023, he received an additional 18-year sentence for trafficking cocaine within the prison.</p><p>The cases of Holloway and Flores garnered international media attention, with Van der Sloot’s arrest being named the top crime story of 2010 by Time magazine. The extensive media coverage led to controversies and investigations, which resulted in the suspension of several Peruvian officials involved in the case.</p><p>Recently, on May 10, 2023, it was announced that Van der Sloot would be extradited to the United States following a statement from Natalee Holloway’s mother. The extradition marks a significant development in the ongoing legal proceedings surrounding his involvement in Holloway’s case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Joran van der Sloot’s Net Worth?</h2><p>Joran van der Sloot’s estimated net worth is not known, and this makes it difficult to determine details of his net worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsButs6rmKdlppa7brDEq2SspJ%2BkwbR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
