Brad Pitt is one of the most prominent and well-known names in Hollywood and other film industries. When it comes to action films, only a few names come to mind, and one of them is Brad Pitt.

His family quickly relocated to Springfield, Missouri, where he resided with his younger siblings, Douglas Mitchell (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969). He was raised as a Southern Baptist and then “oscillated[d] between agnosticism and atheism” after being born into a fundamentalist Christian household. He later reconciled his spiritual ideas. Pitt grew up in Springfield, which he describes as “Mark Twain country, Jesse James country,” with “a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.”</p><p>Pitt went to Kickapoo High School and participated in the golf, swimming, and tennis teams. He was a member of the Key and Forensics clubs at school, as well as school debates and musicals. After graduating from high school in 1982, Pitt enrolled at the University of Missouri, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. Pitt was not ready to settle down as graduation approached. He enjoyed movies—”a portal into different worlds for me”—and, since they were not manufactured in Missouri, he wanted to go to where they were made.</p><p>Pitt left the university two weeks before finishing his degree courses and traveled to Los Angeles, where he took acting classes and worked odd jobs. He cites Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as early acting influences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many houses and cars does Brad Pitt have?</h2><p>Pitt Currently resides in Springfield, Missouri.

According to tax records, Pitt and Angelina Jolie donated more than $8 million to charity in 2006.</p><p>Also, Pitt and Jolie traveled to Pakistan in November 2005 to examine the aftermath of the Kashmir earthquake.
