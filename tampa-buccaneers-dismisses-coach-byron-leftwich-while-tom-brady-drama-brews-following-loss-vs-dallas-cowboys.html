During this time, he was largely credited with merging the ‘No Risk It, No Biscuit’ offense of former coach Bruce Arians with quarterback Tom Brady’s preferred elements of the New England Patriots system.</p><p>The Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV in Brady’s first year with the team. During the 2020 and 2021 seasons, the Buccaneers had the most points per game in the NFL.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/42a6cf1672b69c019a351eb7a9666efb.jpg alt width=1200 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-pagespeed-url-hash=4053854534 onload=pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>However, in 2022 the Buccaneers had the league’s worst rushing attack and the 25th-most points per game, forcing Brady to attempt a career-high 756 passing attempts at age 45. The Buccaneers’ offense was hampered this season by injuries to the offensive line and receiving corps, as well as the retirements of tight end Rob Gronkowski and left guard Ali Marpet, and the loss of right guard Alex Cappa in free agency and wide receiver Antonio Brown.</p><p>Leftwich, 43, had been one of the hottest head-coaching candidates in the NFL last season, having interviewed with the Jacksonville Jaguars (twice), the Chicago Bears, and the New Orleans Saints. His ability to connect with players, having spent 10 seasons in the NFL as a starting quarterback and a backup, is considered his greatest asset.</p><p>His coaching career began with a 2016 internship under Arians with the Arizona Cardinals, and within two years he was named interim offensive coordinator before joining the Buccaneers in 2019.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/068a85c5d41bf4bab84bb08320ec0faa.jpg alt width=1200 height=850 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-pagespeed-url-hash=456664850 onload=pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Buccaneers must now make the right choice for a new offensive coordinator, as Tom Brady is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and their decision could have a significant effect on whether or not he returns for another season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmrZmdpa5urtScmpqmlZq%2FtHnDoqqmoaOosrR5wqiYnKBdl8azu81mo56epKy2pLSMsJ%2BipJViwbC5jJupmpypYrGzrcyaZJuqlazAbrLOpaOor5mjtG64zqyqZq6jYrGiuMuaqmabn6yvsMXSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
