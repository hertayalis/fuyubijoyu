He rose to fame in 2016, with the release of his debut studio album “King of Memphis”. Since then, his success has only grown with subsequent releases, including his latest, “Thinking Out Loud”, debuted in October 2017, only a month after he was shot by an unidentified assailant.</p><p>His net worth has been estimated at $5 million, earned through his successful music career that began in 2008.</p><h3>Young Dolph: A Journey to Success, Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Although born in Chicago, Dolph spent his early years in Memphis, Tennessee, after his family, including four siblings, relocated. Raised by his grandmother due to his parents’ involvement in drug dealing and frequent run-ins with the law, he had to find a way to support himself and his family. His passion for music became his ticket to a better life, especially after his grandmother passed away in 2008 from lung cancer. Despite surviving a life-threatening car accident that same year, Dolph forged ahead with his career, establishing his own record label, Paper Route Empire, and producing his music.</p><p>His journey to success was marked by a series of underground mixtapes such as “Paper Route Campaign” (2008), “Welcome 2 Dolph World” (2010), and “High-Class Street Music” (2011), all contributing to his growing reputation in the Memphis rap scene. His collaborations with other established rappers such as Colonel Loud and T.I., as well as his work with O.T. Genasis, further bolstered his net worth.</p><p>Determined to take his career to the next level, Dolph released his first full-length studio album, “King of Memphis”, in February 2016, featuring hits like “Royalty,” and “Get Paid”. The album’s success elevated his popularity and net worth.</p><p>Despite encountering a shooting incident in early 2017, Dolph showed resilience, and his album “Bulletproof” further increased his net worth and solidified his standing in the hip-hop industry. His subsequent release, “Thinking Out Loud,” became his highest-charting album to date after reaching No. 16 on the US Billboard 200.</p><p>Dolph has been tight-lipped about his personal life, and his relationship status remains a mystery.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 11, 1985</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/youngdolph</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/YoungDolph</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/youngdolph/</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/young-dolph-mn0003085896</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>1017 Records, Paper Route Empire, Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Bulletproof (2017), Thinking Out Loud (2017, CD), Tracking Numbers (with Berner, 2017), Welcome 2 Dolph World (2010), High-Class Street Music (2011), King of Memphis (2016), 16 Zips (2015, mixtape), Paper Route Campaign (mixtape, 2008), Black Sheep Don’t Grin (2014), South Memphis Kingpin (2013, mixtape)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>#49 – Billboard 200 chart (album King of Memphis, 2016)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Young Dolph “100 Shots” (2017, WSHH Exclusive – Official Music Video), Young Dolph – Play Wit Yo Bitch (2017, Official Video), Young Dolph “What’s The Deal” (2017, WSHH Exclusive – Official Music Video)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Rolling Loud Festival 2017 (NOS Events Center, San Bernardino, CA, US), Team Bigga Rankin Industry Sportlight Block Party (2013), Skyline Sports Bar & Grill (24 Jun 13)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><p><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiwqK2enHqlu8upn2asmJp6s63PqZyrq12eurG%2BxKyqoq6VYsSmrcutn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
