Phoenix Feathers are needed to fully upgrade some of your gear, so being able to get it for free in your Room of Requirement is a lot better than having to go to Hogsmeade to buy it. Unfortunately, it is believed that this bird is extinct in-game. That being said, the rumors are false, and you can get a Phoenix through a specific quest.
