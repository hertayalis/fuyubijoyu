The 52-year-old film festival director broke his silence about their relationship and gave fans quite a bit of insight about what is happening behind the scenes amid <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2862083/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-email-chateau-miraval-lawsuit/>her ongoing drama </a>with ex-husband <a href=# id=auto-tag_brad-pitt_1 data-tag=brad-pitt>Brad Pitt</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Host Jessica Entner of the <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://90who10.com>90Who10</a> podcast didn’t shy away from asking Haven about his involvement with Jolie and her six kids, Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 18, Shiloh, 17, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15, as they navigated the fallout from <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2416645/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-domestic-violence-allegations-proof/>Pitt’s alleged domestic violence incident</a> in 2016 which “unfolded in the public eye.” “That’s where it all started, it started with the protection of her and then of her children, my nieces and nephews,” Haven shared. “There are those are massively formative years; they’re becoming young adults in their early 20s.” <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt.jpg alt="Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Insiders Reveal the Reason Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt’s Kids Reportedly ‘Get Into Arguments’ Over This Subject Amid Their Parents’ Divorce</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Haven is not only present for his sister and the kids, but he also stepped up as a father figure. “That’s so crazy thinking that, but yeah, I think it’s just very natural [to feel protective] and I just want to be there. Very much like my mom [Marcheline Bertrand]. Anytime I’m blessed to be in their presence, I want to be in their presence,” he continued. “I set my life up so I can be present with whatever the situation. I want to be there for them or for her — whatever she’s going through.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">His presence was probably a welcome relief to Jolie who has hinted at the reported abuse and trauma she and the kids suffered through during Pitt’s battle with alcohol. She’s primarily let the court documents tell their side of the horrific story which involved the 2016 private plane incident where the Thelma and Louise star allegedly “<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2635004/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-abuse-court-filing/>choked one of the children</a> and struck another in the face,” per court documents obtained by The New York Times. The altercation continued when Pitt “grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her” and “at one point, he poured beer on Jolie; at another, he poured beer and red wine on the children,” per the legal filing. It’s fortunate that Jolie and her children had Haven to lean on.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Haven usually stays out of the spotlight, but he is probably best remembered for Jolie’s Girl Interrupted award show season in 2000 where they seemed a little too close for comfort. They were often snapped <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/2550937/shocking-oscars-moments/>sharing kisses on the mouth</a> that some critics felt went beyond what Jolie described as “brotherly love.” It turned out to be much ado about nothing as the siblings have proven that their close bond is about family ties and sticking together no matter how tough things get.</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see celebrities who are best friends with their siblings.</strong> <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt.jpg alt="Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Insiders Reveal the Reason Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt’s Kids Reportedly ‘Get Into Arguments’ Over This Subject Amid Their Parents’ Divorce</span></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/celebrity-siblings.jpg alt="Landon Pitt, Lisa Pitt, Doug Pitt, Reagan Pitt, Brad Pitt, Sydney Pitt" width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamlnhXaEkmiYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWKvs7vToZyrZZqWuqa%2FjKGYr52eYq%2BzscCkqmarmaGyr6%2FEZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
