GIGABYTE color codes their models such that the channel range is blue/black, the overclocking range is orange/black, and the gaming range is green/black.&nbsp; The gaming range from GIGABYTE has seen an explosion in terms of models available recently – initially for a couple of generations it was one or two models, but in 2013 we had the following:</span></p><p>GIGABYTE is a very market focused motherboard manufacturer, often designing product to match specific requests in various regions.&nbsp; To this end, over the course of the CES weekend we have the two first new 2014 G1.Sniper motherboards being released on the Z87 platform, aimed more at the mid-range gamer: the G1.Sniper Z5S and the G1.Sniper Z5.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7614/Combo_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Some of the 2013 innovations on the G1.Sniper range include the upgradable OP-AMP feature that lets audio enthusiasts change the operational amplifier to cater their music tastes better, AMP-UP which uses the high end Realtek ALC1150 codec in a tuned and configured environment (EM shield, filter caps, PCB separation of digital and analog signals), USB DAC-UP which provides clean USB power to one USB port to minimize potential fluctuations when using a USB DAC, and Gain Boost to adjust amplification modes depending on the output device.&nbsp; GIGABYTE wraps this up with a Killer network interface to optimize gaming traffic by bypassing the Windows Network Stack.</p><p>The G1.Sniper Z5S will be released first, with the Z5 in a few weeks.&nbsp; The Z5S will have most of the features listed above, and use the Z87 chipset in an x8/x4/x4 configuration for tri-CFX compatible setups or in x8/x8 for two-way SLI, along with AMP-UP, OP-AMP, USB DAC-UP, a Killer NIC, and GIGABYTE’s updated BIOS/Software package for Z87.&nbsp;</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7614/9456_big_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As these are mid-range motherboards, we have the six SATA 6 Gbps from the PCH and six USB 3.0 ports rather than additional controllers: the main selling point here is a basic motherboard improved through the Sniper series features.&nbsp; The main difference between the Z5S and the Z5 will be only two-way CrossFire on the Z5, with also fewer VRMs in the power delivery and the SATA ports at the bottom of the board rather than in the right-angled fashion we usually see.&nbsp; With these specifications they seem straddle the G1.Sniper Z87, which has more VRMs than the Z5 but the same two-way GPU layout than the Z5, as well as more gold plated connectors on the rear IO.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7614/9457_big_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We are waiting for release dates and prices for both models, but we are told the Z5S will be on sale first.&nbsp; We have the G1.Sniper Z87, the middle one of the three, in for review in due course.&nbsp; Stay tuned for that!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIR3fZNonmqrnp69pr6MpqCdqpGjtKZ5xLGnmqajnryvecainpqaqamybrjArqWcoF2vgrR5wKebZrJl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
