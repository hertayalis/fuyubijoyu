The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for how <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a35751205/how-to-watch-oprah-with-meghan-and-harry/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meghan and Harry" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Meghan and Harry</a> are feeling following the broadcast, King said, "I think what is still upsetting to them is that the palace keeps saying they want to work it out privately, but yet they believe, these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan still."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It would also appear that only Harry has had preliminary discussions with the royals. "No one in the royal family has talked to Meghan yet or at this particular time," King revealed. "And I think it's frustrating to them to see that it's a racial conversation about the royal family, when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant. And until you can acknowledge that, I think it's going to be hard to move forward. But they both want to move forward with this. ... At the end of the day, that is Harry's family."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">King also discussed the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a35714696/buckingham-palace-launch-investigation-bullying-allegations/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bullying claims" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">bullying claims</a> alleged by palace staff.

"And, as I say, Meghan has documents to back up everything that she said on Oprah's interview. Everything."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for what Meghan and Harry hope will happen in the future, King explained, "The family has to acknowledge that there are issues, and right now, no one is acknowledging, 'Houston, we have a problem here.' That's really all they want. They want a conversation."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaa2VtgnGDl3FmqaqZo7CmeceaqauxXZi8r8LEq6qarJmku7R5wqGYq6SVqHq4tculoJqlXaO8tXnPq6adrZOptrexjKCYsqSVYriqusZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
