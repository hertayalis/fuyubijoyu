She’d much rather meet someone the old fashioned way, like in a coffee shop or the gym, but that’s not really an option due to being stuck in quarantine.</p><p>She does have her naughty side, as it was revealed in a challenge that she once flipped a coin to decide who she was going home with.</p><p>When asked, what it’s like dating her, she said, “I laugh at inappropriate times, I’m enthusiastic, I burst out in song randomly, believe animals are friends, not food, and love Star Wars marathons! Plus, I’m always extra, like my guac!”</p><p>Although she does consider herself extra, she ultimately is looking for someone that matches her energy. She wants someone that “loves Cely as much as Cely loves Cely.”</p><h2>She’s actually a really great singer</h2>View this post on Instagram<p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunna tell my kids I was Summer Walker (jk she’s the only queen) also link in bio for full vid:)</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CELY VAZQUEZ</a> (@thecelyvazquez) on Nov 24, 2019 at 1:13pm PST</p><p>Not only is she a good singer, but she can also play the guitar.</p><p>Upon stalking her Instagram, it looks like she actually had a callback for another popular show – <a href=#>The Voice</a>.</p><p>Her feed is filled with covers from Summer Walker to Miguel to original compositions – this girl has a voice on her. The beach might be the key to her heart, as in most of her pictures she can be found in the sand.</p><p>The legal secretary has been single for two years.
