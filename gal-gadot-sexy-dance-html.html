The <a href=#>Wonder Woman</a> star’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> is filled with the actress laughing, making strange faces, and looking absolutely gorgeous. Even in a casual outfit of a white top and leans with her hair pulled back, the beauty puts us mortals to shame.</p><p>With the caption “it’s always five o’clock somewhere”, Gal Gadot shows the sexy way she mixes drinks, which would be perfect for a Coyote Ugly remake. When the bartender is one of the most beautiful women on the planet and shakes the drink by gyrating her hips, does the quality of the drink really matter at that point? Given the laughter from behind the camera, this is likely not even a strange occurrence in her house.</p><p>Gal Gadot most recently starred in Kenneth Branagh’s Death on the Nile as the heiress Linnet Ridgeway-Doyle. Prior to that, she was setting new records for Netflix in the original movie Red Notice, alongside co-stars Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. No matter the role, two things are guaranteed with the actress: one, she will look amazing and two, she will forever be known as Wonder Woman.</p><p>When Diana Prince made her cinematic debut during Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, it was widely considered by fans to be the best part of the movie. Gal Gadot brought the Amazon to life, nearly 40 years after Lynda Carter’s seminal television series went off the air. Since then, the actress has played Wonder Woman in two solo movies and the ensemble film, Justice League.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wonder-woman-900x424.jpg><p>With no third solo movie for Wonder Woman currently in production following <a href=#>rumored rewrites</a>, Gal Gadot will instead be portraying DC’s best female hero in Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Whether the appearance is a quick cameo or an extended part of the mythology themed movie is unknown, as new DCU head honcho James Gunn is playing his cards close to his chest. In fact, not much is known at all about the upcoming DC Extended Universe move slate following Gunn’s promotion to co-CEO of the division.</p><p>About the only thing that can be confirmed about Gal Gadot and the DC Extended Universe is that at some point, in some capacity, the <a href=#>actress will be back</a> as Wonder Woman. Most of the DCEU films, following the Warner Bros./Discovery merger, are currently up in the air, with the completed Batgirl film being discarded by the studio. Future films, including Blue Beetle, are now feared by fans to be the next to get the axe from the new corporate overlords.</p><p>Even if she never appears again as Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot’s performance will be the definitive Diana Prince for generations of comic book fans. Her upcoming non-super hero projects include a turn as the Evil Queen for Disney’s live-action Snow White remake and stepping into Elizabeth Taylor’s most famous role as Cleopatra. No matter when the Isreali star <a href=#>returns to the big screen</a>, all eyes will be on her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnl5a5brPAnaatZaOaxbp5w5qlnJ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
