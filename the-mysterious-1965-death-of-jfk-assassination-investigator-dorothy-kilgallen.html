Somewhat surprisingly, Israel then became an out-and-out literary forger, who stole letters from famous figures such as Ernest Hemingway and Noël Coward from public libraries and replaced them with homemade versions, so she could sell the originals to autograph collectors. Later, she created her own letters, imitating the writing style of writers and celebrities. <a href=#>Mark Shaw</a>&nbsp;is adamant that Lee Israel's research into the death of Kilgallen is watertight, and that despite her career as a thief and forger the arguments she makes in the epilogue of "Kilgallen" are credible. However, Israel's cynical second "career" invariably casts doubt on the claims regarding the death of Kilgallen in her biography.</p><p>Experts, meanwhile, have claimed that the theory Kilgallen was murdered has been "thoroughly debunked," according to the <a href=#>San Diego Union-Tribune</a>, while <a href=#>Skeptic</a> magazine&nbsp;notes that even among JFK conspiracy theorists Kilgallen's death is a fringe topic, and that "no one serious" believes she the target of an assassination herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3FqbGpkZMGpsYymsKyslae2sMHSZmhybmVisaat06FkqJ5dn7OsecCsqpqro567osDIqKVmoZ6rsrTAyKCYraeiYrGwvs6tn7Jlm565qK3LpZynZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
