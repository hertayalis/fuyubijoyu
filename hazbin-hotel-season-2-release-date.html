After all, it was five years between the release of the original pilot and the full season airing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/01/HZBNS1FG10100073215Still1463000-6218e7d.jpg><p>However, creator Vivienne Medrano has reassured fans that the wait for season 2 will "definitely" not be as long.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel=noopener>Screen Rant</a>: "I'm a big advocate for letting things take the time they need. And production, I mean, I literally actually don't know the projected release date or aim or anything like that, but roughly season 1 took about one and a half, two years.</p><p>"So I think it's probably similar, just because we are in the early stages. However, that's not nearly as long of a wait, and that's kind of a normal wait for animation. So it'll be a normal wait for animation. But I do think it'll be worth it."</p><p>We will keep this page updated once we have any further information regarding the release of Hazbin Hotel season 2.</p><h2 id=hazbin-hotel-cast-who-could-be-back-for-season-2-2a2a89ac><strong>Hazbin Hotel cast: Who could be back for season 2?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/01/HZBNS1FG10200141117Still3193000-e4356e8.jpg><p>We already know that Erika Henningsen is definitely back as Charlie for season 2, while we would expect the rest of the season 1 cast to return too – including Stephanie Beatriz and Keith David.</p><p><strong>Here's a full list of the central cast for Hazbin Hotel for season 1, who could be back for season 2:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Erika Henningsen as Charlie</strong></li><li><strong>Stephanie Beatriz as Vaggie</strong></li><li><strong>Keith David as Husk</strong></li><li><strong>Kimiko Glenn as Niffty</strong></li><li><strong>Alex Brightman as Sir Pentious</strong></li><li><strong>Blake Roman as Angel Dust</strong></li><li><strong>Amir Talai as Alastor</strong></li><li><strong>Christian Borle as Vo</strong></li><li><strong>Joel Perez as Valentino</strong></li></ul><p class="newsletter-sign-up__disclaimer body-copy-small">By entering your details, you are agreeing to our <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>terms and conditions</a> and <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>privacy policy</a>.
