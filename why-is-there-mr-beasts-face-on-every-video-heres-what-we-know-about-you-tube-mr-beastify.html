The 'YouTube MrBeastify' plugin, which came to light over the weekend, adds an exaggerated image of MrBeast to the thumbnail of every video.</p><p>"Whoever constructed this. Fair play," tweeted internet savant Jay Alto, who has written a large number of essays on how to enlarge YouTube thumbnails in a lab to increase engagement.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>MrBeast suggests Elon Musk to gift a Tesla Cybertruck to YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Internet says 'that would be amazing'</a></p><h2 class=split>What is 'YouTube MrBeastify'?</h2><p>The plugin appears to have been made by a supporter of YouTuber Unnecessary Inventions, who previously made a website dedicated to adding MrBeast to certain thumbnails. “This is indeed a truly unnecessary invention, I love it,” wrote YouTube strategist Connor Brogan.</p><p>MrBeast has been open about his obsession with the art of the YouTube thumbnails and how it helped him earn more money so he could support his contentious philanthropic endeavors and his love of chocolate bars.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Internet unimpressed with Tristan Tate’s ‘hit’ idea for MrBeast’s next video: ‘Kills the actual point of games’</a></p><h2 class=split>‘This is the best thing to ever happen to me’</h2><p>In the event that one of the videos doesn't do well enough, his team creates other variations and switches them out. For videos that were released soon after he had shaved his head, he even added hair using photoshop in order to maintain the constant style. The correct thumbnail, at least according to MrBeast, is worth $10,000. A picture may be worth a thousand words.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Alex wins MrBeast's $450K challenge for enduring 45 days in grocery store, Internet calls it 'most creative ways to give charity'</a></p><p>Many people left reviews for the plugin. One user wrote, “This is the best thing to ever happen to me,” while another fan wrote, “MrBeast has invaded my life and will not leave me alone.” Another fan said, “No matter where I go, from GTA to Linus Tech Tips to music, MrBeast is always watching and always taunting me with free money and free Lamborghinis. I hate this extension, as I have sold my soul to the devil that is mrbeast. 10 stars if possible.”</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
