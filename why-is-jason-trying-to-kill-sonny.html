Assuming, however, that the more recent shooting — this time on Sonny’s private island in Puerto Rico — was done by the same would-be hitman, it seems far more likely that he was the target as opposed to Anna or, in that latter case, Ava.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sonny-ava-duck-gh-abc.jpg alt="Ava and Sonny duck GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>And then, when Sonny began talking to Brick about how this had to be an inside job, things became far clearer. The shooter, he pointed out, “had intimate knowledge of my island. They knew how to get through security, where my men, where my men weren’t. That kind of information’s not easy to get, so it’s got to be somebody I trust.”</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Where is Spencer?&nbsp;</a></p><p>A few members of the inner circle would have that kind of knowledge, including one very obvious suspect: Dex. Not surprisingly, suspicious eyes are looking his way. But as is often the case, the characters on the canvas don’t have as much information as do we, the viewers. Upon looking at some of the recent developments which have come to light&nbsp; — and keeping in mind Sonny’s words about the shooter’s “intimate knowledge”&nbsp; — it becomes crystal clear who’s been targeting the Teflon Don: the soon-to-return-from-the-dead Jason.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brick-sonny-intel-gh-abc.jpg alt="Brick and Sonny catch up GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Absolutely nobody else on the canvas — and possibly the planet — knows as much about the inner workings of Sonny’s empire as Jason. As we mentioned at the top of this story, however, this answer only leads to many, many more questions. Such as why Jason has turned on Sonny. And if he’s acting on someone else’s behalf, whose… and why?</p><p>We also can’t help but wonder if this is a case of a storyline shifting midstream. Let’s not forget that back when Anna and/or Sonny were targeted back in July of last year, nobody knew that Steve Burton would be jumping from&nbsp;Days of Our Lives&nbsp;(where he’s wrapping up his stint as Harris) back to&nbsp;General Hospital. While the plan might have been to play this same reveal but with a recast Jason, that seems highly unlikely given how poorly that scenario played the last time they tried bringing in a new actor to play the part.</p><p>Much more likely is that we’ll never know what the original plan was, especially if our suspicions about the change in plans are correct. With everyone from Sonny to a newly-returned Jagger — sorry,&nbsp;John — attempting to suss out the shooter, and Burton slated to appear on screen in a matter of weeks, we should soon find out the truth as the next chapter of this saga unfolds!</p><p><strong>This ain’t Jason’s first resurrection, as evidenced by the gallery below in which we look at all the times <a href=# rel=noopener>he’s (nearly) died</a> only to resurface!&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvNnq6sZ2dmhHJ9lWiuobFdnsButsCspqdlpKfGqrrGZquoZZueua150qilp7Ff</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
